                                  <p class="needsPar">Advanced Finishing USA offers both standard aesthetic powder coating and Decoral patented dye-sublimation technology that is proven successful for both indoors and outdoor applications.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar"><b>Interior Applications: </b>Decoral Dye Sublimation is a very durable coating that can be used anywhere, even in high traffic areas. Handrails, elevator interiors, ceiling tiles, molding, doors, window frames, columns, display cases and wall partitions can all be made to look like wood, marble or granite. We have delivered miles of wood-grain railing extrusions for architectural applications such as hotels where fire codes prohibit the use of wood. We have also produced thousands of fixtures such as door handles and window cranks.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar"><b>Exterior Applications </b>Our work also includes a unique capability for producing exterior wall murals found on high profile buildings across the United States. The Decoral system can also be used to decorate flat sheet and panel products as well as 3D products such as wheels, door handles, plates and hardware. This finishing has withstood many hours of accelerated environmental testing and outdoor testing and has gained AAMA certifications 2603 and 2504. With the proper pre-treatment, nearly all of the wood grain products can be used in outdoor applications.</p>

                                  <p class="needsPar">Traditional aesthetic powder coating is provided in a wide spectrum of colors and powder compound.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar">There are over 300 combinations of Decoral Dye-Sublimation designs currently in use, though all are not readily available. Advanced Finishing USA has five wood grains in stock that can be applied to a light or dark base coat and a white marble. That means there is an in-stock selection of 11 possible designs. Custom designs are possible for higher volume customers.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar">Dye Sublimation requires two coats: a base coat on which the Dye-sublimation inks are transferred and a clear coat. Clear coat is not required for wood-grain finishes.</p>
