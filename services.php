                                  <p class="needsPar">A quality and durable finish is defined by adhesion and coverage. The secret behind attaining durable powder coat adhesion is our attention to surface preparation and cleaning. It sounds basic but our attention to this detail makes all the difference when it comes to durability of the finish coat.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar">When your equipment or product arrives at Advanced Finishing U.S.A., we pre-inspect it to make sure no damage occurred in shipping. Before coating we can prepare your parts using several methods to ensure the performance of the specified coating system.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar">We offer: Burn-off, Chemical Stripping, Cleaning, Glass Beading, Grinding, and Shot Blast services to prepare all metal surfaces. </p>

                                          <p class="needsPar">To ensure the maximum cleanliness of the surface, we may place your parts in one of our DEP Approved burn-off ovens. This will remove any previous coating, machining oils or greases that may have accumulated during fabrication or machining.</p>
                                          <h1 class="needsbodyHeading">CHEMICAL STRIPPING:</h1>
                                          <p class="needsPar">For thin gauge, aluminum die cast, or parts that cannot withstand the heat of the burn-off oven, we can chemically strip the part to bare metal. This is especially important for parts requiring rework.</p>
                                          <h1 class="needsbodyHeading">GRINDING:</h1>
                                          <p class="needsPar">We may also prep parts by radiusing edges, grinding welds, and cleaning off weld spatters.</p>

                                          <p class="needsPar">For more aggressive pre-treatment we can sandblast using aluminum oxide to provide an SSPC-SP 5 white metal finish for maximum coating adhesion.</p>

                                          <p class="needsPar">To achieve maximum coating performance for your product, we clean parts using a cleaning method most suitable to the metallic make-up and surface condition. We clean aluminum parts to AAMA standards. Our wash lines use heated alkaline cleaners, heated iron phosphate pre-treatment, water rinses (using reverse osmosis filtered water), and bi-metal sealers. For products too large for our line we have a high-pressure steam cleaner that uses the same chemistry as our wash lines.</p>

                                  <p class="needsPar">Powder coatings are precision-applied by electrostatic spraying or by fluid-bed dipping. Our automated coating lines and large batch coating areas allow us to process thousands of components and parts each day. After coating, each piece is heat-cured in an oven, where the tough plastic film is permanently fused to the metal. Our ovens are calibrated by an outside, independent contractor once a year to ensure accurate temperatures. We also have Datapaqâ„¢ technology for monitoring individual part temperatures while curing.</p>
